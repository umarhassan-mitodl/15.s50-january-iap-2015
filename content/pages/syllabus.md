### Policy on Collaborations

You may interact with fellow students when preparing your homework solutions. However, you must write up solutions on your own.

If you do collaborate on homework, you must cite, in your written solution, your collaborators. If you use sources beyond the course materials in one of your solutions, you must also cite such sources.

## PokerStars Home League

Pokerstars has created a play-money Home League for this MIT course for registered students. Each student must begin playing Beginners Only Turbos before moving on to Daily Turbos. Beginners Only Turbos pay out the top 20% and cashing in at least one of these tournaments (or alternatively playing in ten) is a requirement for passing the course.

### Tournament Leaderboard Points

League rankings are based on tournament leaderboard points, which are paid out in a way similar to tournament prizes. With the exception of the Beginners Only Turbos, TLB points are paid out to the top 34% of players, according to the following formula:

\\(   Points = if \\:\\: \[ k > n \* 0.34 \] \\:\\: then \\:\\: \[ 0 \] \\: \\: else \\:\\: n \* { { \\sqrt{n} \\over \\sqrt{k} } \\over { \\sum\_{x=1}^{int(.34n)} {\\sqrt{n} \\over \\sqrt{x}} } } \\)

**n** is the number of entrants

**k** is the place of finish (k=1 for the first-place finisher, and so on)

So first place in a 10-person turbo would earn you 4.38 TLB points, second would earn 3.10, and third would earn 2.52 for a total of 10.0 points awarded.
